# Epoxia

Epoxia is a premium template [Bloggrify](https://github.com/hlassiege/bloggrify). 
It provides a dark mode, a clean, accessible, responsive and SEO-efficient blog template.

The demo is available [here](https://epoxia.bloggrify.com)

## Getting Started

WARNING:
Even if it's only a matter of downloading files and writing markdown, you'll need to have some knowledge of git, markdown, and the command line

**In order to run Epoxia on your local machine, you need to have Node.js and Npm installed.**


To get started, you can read the official documentation [here](https://bloggrify.com/introduction/installation). You'll find all the information you need to install and use Bloggrify 

However, **instead of cloning the "Mistral" template**, you should use the "Epoxia" template that you have downloaded.

Then you can install the dependencies (from the root of the project)

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

and run the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```



Of course, you can remove all the existing blog posts from the **content** folder and start from scratch. Those are just examples.
