> This article was originally published on [Empathy.co Engineering Blog](https://engineering.empathy.co/on-call-engineering-approach/) and has been updated with modern practices for 2025.

At modern engineering organizations, On-Call rotations remain crucial for maintaining service reliability. Following the "you build it, you own it" principle, teams maintain autonomy and ownership over their services. By 2025, this approach has evolved to incorporate AI assistance, enhanced monitoring, and improved engineer well-being practices.

## Modern On-Call Foundation

### Core Principles
1. Team autonomy
2. Service ownership
3. Operational readiness
4. AI-enhanced monitoring
5. Engineer well-being

### Key Components (2025) 
Essential Tools:
